Instructions:
Download CASIAv2 dataset for training and Coverage dataset for testing.
Set path accordingly.
After checking all the requirements, run Team_5.ipynb on Google Colab.

Description:
Main 3 parts of the code : 
    1   Normal MVSSNet (as described in the paper)
    2   MVSSNet with 2 layers removed
    3   MVSSNet with ResNet-18 blocks
Each of these parts has a training and testing codes.

At the end, there are 2 related implementations:
    1   FCN
    2   MVSSNet++
and their training and testing.
